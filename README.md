# Network Scanner Script

This bash script is designed to facilitate network scanning using `nmap`. It retrieves local and public IP addresses, lists available network interfaces, and allows the user to select an IP address, subnet mask, ports, and scan type for the network scan.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, ensure you have the following dependencies installed on your system:

- `nmap`
- `curl`

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install -y nmap curl
